# Citibike Visualization

## Overview of the Analysis:

In this analysis Tableau was used to visualize data about a rental bike company's clients in New York. The insights gained from these visualizations make it easier to determine demographic, time, and location preferences of the riders.
The visualizations can be found on [This Public Tableau Storyboard.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/26735TDCN?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Results

* Number of bike trips for all riders and gender for each hour of each day of the week: There are over Twenty thousands trips between 6am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Wednesdays and Sundays seem to have the least demand for bikesharing.
* Bikes are more often than not checked out for 4-6 hours at a time. This is consistent for both male and female users.

## Summary

The main points that can be extrapolated from the data are as follows:

* Men are the primary users of Citibike's bike sharing
* Subscribers most often utilize bikes than regular customers. It would be advantageous to have a call to arms or incentive to convert as many customers to subscribers.
* Bike usage is highest during commute hours during weekdays and overall during the weekend.

Future questions that visualizations could assist in answering are:

* How does usage vary between more spread out landscapes such as rural or suburban areas?
* How does usage vary between seasons? Are there winterization protocols that could be made to imrpove rentals during expectedly low months?
